# Weather Dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). A custom Webpack 
configuration is in use (via [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)) in order to
set up CSS modules in the way I'm used to working with them and also to add a couple convenient features through
Babel. Otherwise, this is a pretty standard CRA based project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
